## Informed consent

By clicking the “I consent” button, you agree to participate in the Gripiradar study
and accept that your data will be processed for this survey.
The survey aims to identify symptoms that may indicate the presence of respiratory
infectious diseases, e.g., influenza, the new coronavirus. Determining whether the
number of people with symptoms is increasing or decreasing is important from the
population health viewpoint. More information about the purpose of the survey
and your rights can be found in the data protection conditions.
