## Survey data

Data is collected and analyzed only within the framework of scientific research and only for the
following purposes:

- to carry out research and data analysis focused on the spread of infectious diseases in Estonia
and Europe,
- to publish the results of the statistical analysis, including presenting the results as graphical
outputs,
- providing research participants, or users, with information about the results of the research (for
example, how many of the registered users suffer from the flu or some other infectious disease).
For the aforementioned purposes, we may process the following personal data:
- demographic data, zip code of home and workplace, data on family composition,
- background information that increases the risk of an infectious disease, such as data on existing
health conditions (data that indicate belonging to a risk group, which is why it is advisable to get
vaccinated against influenza and/or SARS-CoV-2), data on employment and lifestyle,
- data on symptoms reported on a weekly symptom questionnaire.

Encrypted data collected as part of the study will be processed by University of Tartu
